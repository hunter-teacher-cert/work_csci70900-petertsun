/*
  Goal: build a program that calculates factorial
        and asks a user to enter the value and then prints out
        the factorial of the value
*/

Questions for students
Q: Do you want to calculate factorial by showing the math work in main()
   or do you want to calculate factorial in a separate method? Explain.

Q: Why is it advantageous to do them separately  in main() and fib() method?

// Build a program that gets the user's input value
// This code is in file FactorialDriver.java

public class FactorialDriver {
  public static void main(string args[]) {

    int n = 0;
    Scanner UserInput = new Scanner(System.in);

    System.out.print("To calculate the factorial of a number, ");
    System.out.println("enter the number. Number must be a non-negative integer");
    n = UserInput.nextInt();

    System.out.println("User inputs " + n);
  }

}

Next step:

Q: What is one subgoal in this program?

Q for students: How do you determine the terminating condition?
How do you know the loop should end when i < (n + 1)?


// Build a program that gets the user's input value
// This code is in file FactorialDriver.java

import java.util.*;

public class FactorialDriver {

  public static int factorial(int n) {
    int i = 0; // index
    int product = 1; // if n = 0, product is defaulted to be one. 0! = 1

    for (i = 1; i < n + 1; i++) {
      product = product * i;
    }
    return product;
  }


  public static void main(String args[]) {

    int n = 0;
    Scanner UserInput = new Scanner(System.in);

    System.out.println("To calculate the factorial of a number, ");
    System.out.println("enter the number.\n(Number must be a non-negative integer)");
    n = UserInput.nextInt();

    System.out.println("Factorial " + n + "! = " + factorial(n) );
  }

}
