NetLogo allows people to do animation and draw graphs.
First, we will draw a circle in the center of a screen.
Then, we will do an animation of the circle moving to the right.

Students can do a group activity of animating the circle going to the top.
Also, we will reconvene to discuss how they did it, and together animate
the circle bouncing off the edge.
