## Lesson objective: Students can explain conditional statements and
                     evaluation of a logic statement.

### Aim: How do we explain conditional statement?

### Warm up
time: 10 minutes
Assign students to groups of three or two students. Ask them to
sketch a pseudo program that uses System.out.println to display
information and ScannerObject's method to get input from the user.
Q: How similar are the pseudo codes written by different groups?
They would notice that their programs follow a linear progression.

### Lesson Content
time: 15 minutes

1. Logic statements - an expression that is evaluated to be either true or false
a) greater than, less than, equal to, and, or, not
b) x > y. Say x = 10, y = 8. Statement is true. But, say x = 7 and y = 8
   the statement is not true (we say false).
c) If (logical expression) then do this (when expression is true) else
   do that (when expression is false)
d) That was pseudocode, the real syntax is if (logic statement) { do this} else
                                           {do that}

example: int x = 9, y = 20;
if (x > y) { print("x is greater than y")} else { print(" x is not greater than y")}

### Lesson Activity
time: 15 minutes
Write a conditional statement that decides whether the student's
numerical grade is passing or failing.

Write a logic expression that asks if a number is within a range of numbers
(say 0 to 100).

Write a nested if statement that determines whether a number is greater than,
less than, or equal to a constant number (say 0). - challenge question

Students work together in a group to do one of the three exercises.
Check their progress with their responses on slack channel.

### Closing
time: 10 minutes
Students showed their programs to the class and explain
their programs in plain English.
